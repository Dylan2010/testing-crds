# Testing CRDs

This repo accompanies the talk [Testing Kubernetes CRDs](https://kccncchina2018english.sched.com/event/FuJa/testing-kubernetes-crds-christie-wilson-google)
at Kubecon Shanghai 2018.

* [Unit tests](#unit-tests)
* [Integration tests](#integration-tests)
* [End-to-end tests](#end-to-end-tests)

These example tests use several controller implementations:

* [Two client-go based implementations](#client-go)
* [A kubebuilder based implementation](#kubebuilder-controller)

## Tests

TODO: small CRD testing pyramid

### Unit tests

TODO: add more functionality to the controllers so it's worth having tests for the units

### Integration tests

There are two kinds of integration tests in this repo:

* [kubebuilder integration tests](#integration-tests-with-kubebuilder)
* [client-go unit tests with fakes](#integration-tests-with-client-go)

#### Integration tests with kubebuilder

These tests are generated by kubebuilder and use [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).
They will start a controller process and api server locally.

The test (which hasn't been modified from the default) lives in
[feline_controller_test.go](kubebuilder/pkg/controller/feline/feline_controller_test.go).

To run these tests:

```bash
go test ./pkg/controller/feline
```

#### Integration tests with client-go

### End to end tests

After you have [deployed the controller](#deploying), you can run the integration tests against
[the `current-context` cluster in your kube config](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/):

```bash
go test -v -count=1 -tags=e2e ./client-go/test
```

_`-count=1` is [the idiomatic way to disable test caching](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10#test)._

You can override the kubeconfig and context if you'd like:

```bash
go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 ./client-go/test --kubeconfig ~/special/kubeconfig --cluster myspecialcluster
```
## Example controllers

This repo contains 3 implementations of [the cat controller](#description):

* [The tightly coupled client-go controller](#coupled-controller)
* [The better factored client-go controller](#factored-controller)
* [The kubebuilder controller](#kubebuilder)

### Description

The Cat controller watches for `Cat` resources to be created. When they are, it creates a `Deployment` of an
nginx service with the same name as the `Cat`.

Interestingly, kubebuilder would not allow me to create a resource called `Cat`, so in the kubebuilder version
the CRD is called `Feline` instead.

#### client-go controllers

##### Deploying

The controllers can be built and deployed with [`ko`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/master/cmd/ko),
which requires the environment variable `KO_DOCKER_REGISTRY` to be set to
a docker registry you can push to (i.e. one you've logged into using [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)
or via [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication)):

```bash
# This currenly deploys only the well-factored controller.
# We can't really run both b/c they'll try to reconcile the same objects.
ko apply -f client-go/config/
```

You can remove it with:

```bash
ko delete -f client-go/config/
```

You can get controller logs with:

```bash
kubectl -n cattopia logs $(kubectl -n cattopia get pods -l app=cat-controller -o name)
```

##### Running locally

You can run the controllers locally by building it with go and running the binary directly:

```bash
# Add the CRD def'n to your k8s cluster
kubectl apply -f client-go/config/300-cat.yaml

# Build one of the controllers and run it locally
go build -o cat-controller ./client-go/cmd/coupled-controller
# or 
go build -o cat-controller ./client-go/cmd/factored-controller

# Run the built controller
./cat-controller -kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config

# Deploy the example Cat instance
kubectl apply -f client-go/example.yaml

# Look at the created resources
kubectl get cats
kubectl get deployments
```

##### Coupled controller

The coupled controller lives in:

* [cmd/coupled-controller](cmd/coupled-controller)
* [pkg/controller/coupled](pkg/controller/coupled)

In this controller, all of the business logic is implemented directly in the controller's `syncHandler`.

##### Factored controller

The well factored controller lives in:

* [cmd/factored-controller](cmd/factored-controller)
* [pkg/controller/factored](pkg/controller/factored)

This controller is a refactored verwsion of [the coupled controller](#coupled-controller). 
In this controller, the business logic has been moved into packages outside the controller
itself, and the functions in the [todo](TODO) package are implemented loosely as a
[functional core](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell).

#### Kubebuilder based controller

This controller was created with kubebuilder by running:

```bash
kubebuilder init --domain bobcatfish.com --license apache2 --owner "The Kubernetes authors"
kubebuilder create api --group cat --version v1alpha1 --kind Feline
```

Couldn't use `Cat` as resource name b/c kubebuilder complained:

```bash
kubebuilder create api --group cat --version v1alpha1 --kind Cat
...
2018/11/11 14:53:54 Kind must be camelcase (expected CAT was Cat)
```

##### Running

Use `make` to interact with it

```bash
# To test and build
make

# To run a controller process locally
make run

# To deploy to the kube cluster pointed to by your current context
make deploy
```
